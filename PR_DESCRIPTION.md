## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE.md - System Architecture

Detailed technical architecture covering:

### Component Design
- **MCP Orchestrator** - Request routing, context management, circuit breakers
- **5 MCP Servers** with complete implementation specs:
  - YFinance Trader (Python) - Market data + 20 technical indicators
  - ML Predictor (Python) - XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest models
  - Alpaca Trading (Node.js) - Order execution with risk checks
  - Portfolio Manager (Python) - Risk metrics, position sizing (Kelly Criterion)
  - Auth Server (Node.js) - Firebase authentication, JWT tokens

### Data Architecture
- **PostgreSQL Schema**: 7 tables (trades, predictions, portfolio_snapshots, etc.)
- **Redis Caching**: Multi-tier caching with TTL strategies
- **Data Flow**: External APIs ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Database

### ML Architecture
- **LSTM Model**: 3 layers, 128 units, attention mechanism
- **XGBoost**: 100 trees, max depth 6, learning rate 0.01
- **Feature Engineering**: 100+ features from technical indicators
- **Online Learning**: Continuous model updates with drift detection
- **Training Pipeline**: Data collection ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Deployment

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose**: 11 services orchestrated
- **MacBook M4 Optimization**: Metal GPU, Accelerate BLAS, 8-bit quantization
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, JWT auth, rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards

## üöÄ DEVELOPMENT.md - MVP-First Development Roadmap

**Core Philosophy**: Validate profitability with backtesting BEFORE building full system.

### MVP Strategy (4 Weeks)

**Week 1: Data Foundation**
- YFinance MCP server
- 20 essential technical indicators
- Redis caching
- Data validation pipeline

**Week 2: Machine Learning**
- XGBoost model (binary classification)
- Feature engineering (50-100 features)
- Training pipeline with walk-forward validation
- Target: >65% accuracy

**Week 3: Backtesting**
- Event-driven backtesting engine
- ML-based mean reversion strategy
- 5-year historical simulation (2020-2024)
- **üö® DECISION POINT 1**: If Sharpe <1.2 ‚Üí STOP or PIVOT

**Week 4: Paper Trading Setup**
- Paper trading engine
- CLI interface
- Integration tests
- Documentation

### Validation Phase (Weeks 5-8)

- Run paper trading for 4 weeks
- Monitor daily performance
- Track model accuracy vs backtest
- **üö® DECISION POINT 2**: If unprofitable ‚Üí STOP or EXTEND

### Success Criteria

**Must Pass to Continue:**
- Sharpe Ratio: >1.2
- Total Return: >50% over 5 years
- Maximum Drawdown: <20%
- Win Rate: >55%
- Model Accuracy: >65%

### Why XGBoost First (Not LSTM)?

- Faster to train (minutes vs hours)
- More interpretable (feature importance)
- Less data hungry
- Can validate hypothesis in weeks, not months

### What's EXCLUDED from MVP

‚ùå Web dashboard (use CLI)
‚ùå Multiple models (just XGBoost)
‚ùå Real-time streaming (historical OK)
‚ùå Authentication (single user)
‚ùå Docker containers (venv OK)
‚ùå Advanced features (prove it works first!)

**Rationale**: These don't help validate if ML can predict prices profitably.

## Key Insights

1. **Validation Before Building**: Most trading systems fail due to unprofitable strategies, not bad engineering. Prove profitability with backtesting FIRST.

2. **Fast Feedback Loops**: Know in 4 weeks if this works. Use simplest model, simplest interface, simplest strategy.

3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Clear go/no-go criteria. No sunk cost fallacy.

4. **Fail Fast**: If backtest shows Sharpe <1.2, STOP immediately and reassess.

5. **Simplicity = Speed**: MVP should be functional, not pretty. Add features ONLY after proving core hypothesis.

## Next Steps

After this PR merges:

1. Set up development environment (Python 3.11, Redis, PostgreSQL)
2. Start Week 1: Build YFinance MCP server
3. Week 2: Train XGBoost model
4. Week 3: Backtest and validate (CRITICAL DECISION POINT)

**Ready for review.** These documents provide complete product, technical, and development guidance with a strong focus on rapid validation of the core hypothesis: Can ML predict stock prices profitably?
