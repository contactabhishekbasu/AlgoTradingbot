## Development Philosophy

### MVP-First Approach

**Core Principle:** Build the absolute minimum to prove the core hypothesis, then iterate based on results.

**Why This Matters:**
- Trading systems are complex - most fail not due to engineering but due to unprofitable strategies
- We must validate the ML models can generate alpha BEFORE investing in full infrastructure
- Fast feedback loops are critical - know if this works in weeks, not months

**Our Hypothesis to Prove:**
> "Machine learning models (XGBoost + technical indicators) can predict price movements with >65% accuracy and generate profitable trading signals with Sharpe ratio >1.2 when backtested on historical data."

### Three-Phase Strategy

```
Phase 1: MVP (4 weeks)
└─> Build minimal working system
    └─> Backtest on historical data
        └─> DECISION POINT ✓

Phase 2: Validation (4 weeks)                    ← Only if Phase 1 succeeds
└─> Paper trading validation
    └─> Refine models and strategies
        └─> DECISION POINT ✓

Phase 3: Production (8 weeks)                    ← Only if Phase 2 succeeds
└─> Full system build-out
    └─> Advanced features
        └─> LAUNCH ✓
```

**Key Insight:** We STOP at each decision point and evaluate. No sunk cost fallacy.

## MVP Definition

### What IS in MVP (Critical Path Only)

#### 1. Data Layer
- **YFinance MCP Server** (minimal)
  - Fetch OHLCV historical data
  - Calculate 20 essential technical indicators:
    - Momentum: RSI(14), RSI(21), Stochastic, Williams %R
    - Trend: SMA(20), SMA(50), EMA(12), EMA(26), MACD, ADX
    - Volatility: Bollinger Bands, ATR, Standard Deviation
    - Volume: OBV, VWAP, Volume SMA
    - Price: Returns (1d, 5d, 20d), Log Returns
  - Cache in Redis (simple TTL-based)
  - **Timeline:** Week 1

#### 2. ML Model (Single Model Focus)
- **XGBoost Predictor** (not LSTM yet - XGBoost is faster)
  - Binary classification: UP (+2% in 5 days) vs DOWN
  - 50-100 features from technical indicators
  - Walk-forward training (252 days train, 21 days test)
  - **Why XGBoost first?**
    - Faster to train (minutes vs hours for LSTM)
    - More interpretable (feature importance)
    - Proven performance in research
    - Less data hungry than deep learning
  - **Timeline:** Week 2

#### 3. Backtesting Engine
- **Historical Simulation**
  - Load historical data (2020-2024)
  - Walk-forward testing (no lookahead bias)
  - Transaction costs: 0.1% per trade
  - Slippage: $0.01 per share
  - Calculate metrics: Sharpe, win rate, max drawdown, total return
  - Generate equity curve and trade log
  - **Timeline:** Week 3

#### 4. Trading Strategy
- **Simple ML-Based Mean Reversion**
  - Entry: ML predicts UP + RSI < 40
  - Exit: ML predicts DOWN OR RSI > 60 OR 5-day holding period
  - Stop loss: -3%
  - Position size: Equal weight, max 5 positions
  - Universe: Top 20 liquid stocks (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, etc.)
  - **Timeline:** Week 2-3

#### 5. Command-Line Interface
- **Simple Python CLI**
  - `python cli.py backtest --strategy mean_reversion --period 2020-2024`
  - `python cli.py train --model xgboost --symbols AAPL,GOOGL --period 2y`
  - `python cli.py predict --symbol AAPL`
  - `python cli.py paper-trade --capital 100000 --strategy mean_reversion`
  - **Timeline:** Week 4

#### 6. Database (Minimal)
- **PostgreSQL**
  - Tables: predictions, backtest_results, paper_trades
  - No complex schemas yet
  - **Timeline:** Week 3

#### 7. Basic Risk Management
- **Essential Rules Only**
  - Maximum position size: 20% of capital
  - Maximum positions: 5 concurrent
  - Stop loss: 3% per position
  - Daily loss limit: 5% of capital
  - **Timeline:** Week 3

### What is NOT in MVP (Can Wait)

❌ **NOT in MVP:**
- Web dashboard (use CLI + Jupyter notebooks)
- Multiple ML models / ensemble (just XGBoost)
- LSTM or deep learning (too slow to train for MVP)
- Real-time streaming data (historical is enough)
- Authentication system (single user, local only)
- Alpaca API integration (backtest only for now)
- Portfolio optimizer (simple equal weight)
- Advanced risk models (Kelly Criterion, etc.)
- Monitoring/alerting infrastructure
- Docker containerization (virtual env is fine)
- MCP orchestrator (direct server calls)
- Sentiment analysis
- Multiple strategies
- Parameter optimization (use sensible defaults)

**Why exclude these?**
- They don't help validate the core hypothesis
- They add weeks/months to timeline
- They create maintenance burden
- We can add them AFTER we prove the model works

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards

**Python Style:**
```python
# Use type hints
def calculate_rsi(prices: pd.Series, period: int = 14) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculate Relative Strength Index.

    Args:
        prices: Series of closing prices
        period: RSI period (default 14)

    Returns:
        Series of RSI values (0-100)
    """
    pass

# Use docstrings
# Use meaningful variable names
# Keep functions small (<50 lines)
# Use logging, not print statements
```

**Testing:**
```python
# Unit tests for all core functions
def test_rsi_calculation():
    prices = pd.Series([100, 102, 101, 103, 105])
    rsi = calculate_rsi(prices, period=3)
    assert 0 <= rsi.iloc[-1] <= 100
    assert not rsi.isna().any()

# Integration tests for workflows
def test_backtest_pipeline():
    result = run_backtest('mean_reversion', '2023-01-01', '2023-12-31')
    assert result['sharpe_ratio'] > 1.0
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Coverage:** All core functions
**Framework:** pytest
**Target:** 80% code coverage

```python
# tests/test_indicators.py
def test_rsi():
    """Test RSI calculation."""
    pass

# tests/test_model.py
def test_xgboost_prediction():
    """Test model prediction."""
    pass

# tests/test_backtest.py
def test_backtest_metrics():
    """Test metric calculations."""
    pass
```

### Integration Tests

**Coverage:** End-to-end workflows

```python
# tests/integration/test_pipeline.py
def test_full_prediction_pipeline():
    """
    Test: Data fetch → Features → Model → Prediction
    """
    symbol = 'AAPL'
    data = yfinance_server.get_data(symbol)
    features = feature_engineer.create_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    assert prediction['confidence'] > 0.5
```

### Backtesting Tests

**Coverage:** Strategy validation

```python
# tests/backtest/test_strategies.py
def test_mean_reversion_backtest():
    """
    Run backtest on known period, verify metrics.
    """
    result = backtest_engine.run(
        strategy='mean_reversion',
        start='2023-01-01',
        end='2023-12-31',
        symbols=['AAPL']
    )
    assert result['sharpe_ratio'] > 1.0
    assert result['total_return'] > 0
```

### Performance Tests

**Coverage:** Speed and resource usage

```python
# tests/performance/test_latency.py
def test_prediction_latency():
    """Ensure predictions are fast enough."""
    import time

    start = time.time()
    prediction = model.predict('AAPL')
    latency = time.time() - start

    assert latency < 0.1  # <100ms
```

## Success Definition

### MVP Success = Answer These Questions

1. **Does the ML model predict price movements better than random?**
   - Target: >65% accuracy (vs 50% random)

2. **Do the predictions translate to profitable trades?**
   - Target: Sharpe >1.2, positive returns

3. **Does the strategy work out-of-sample?**
   - Target: Similar performance on test set

4. **Does it work in live conditions?**
   - Target: Paper trading matches backtest (±20%)

5. **Is it reliable and maintainable?**
   - Target: Runs 24/7 without issues

**If YES to all 5 → Proceed to production build**
**If NO to any → Investigate and fix or pivot**

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Bias to Action
- Favor doing over planning
- Build, test, iterate quickly
- Learn from real results, not theory

### 2. Data-Driven Decisions
- Every decision backed by metrics
- No gut feelings or wishful thinking
- If backtest fails, STOP

### 3. Fail Fast
- Know in 4 weeks if MVP works
- Don't spend 6 months on a bad idea
- Sunk cost fallacy is our enemy

### 4. Simplicity First
- Start with simplest solution
- Add complexity only when needed
- Complex ≠ Better

### 5. Validation Over Features
- Working basic system > feature-rich broken system
- Prove value before scaling
- Users don't care about code elegance

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   brew install redis postgresql
   ```

2. **Start Week 1 tasks**
   - Scaffold YFinance MCP server
   - Implement basic data fetching
   - Set up Redis locally

3. **Create project board**
   - GitHub Projects or Trello
   - Track Week 1 tasks
   - Daily standup with yourself

4. **Define success metrics**
   - Write down exact numbers for go/no-go
   - Commit to following the data
   - Prepare for potential failure

---

## Conclusion

**The Plan:**
1. Build MVP in 4 weeks
2. Backtest thoroughly - if it doesn't work on historical data, it won't work live
3. Paper trade for 4 weeks to validate
4. Make go/no-go decision based on data
5. Only build full system if proof of concept succeeds

**The Mindset:**
- We're validating a hypothesis, not building a product (yet)
- Willing to kill the project if it doesn't work
- Fast feedback loops are critical
- Data > intuition

**The Commitment:**
- 4 weeks to MVP
- 8 weeks to validation
- Clear decision criteria
- No sunk cost fallacy

**Let's build it. 🚀**
